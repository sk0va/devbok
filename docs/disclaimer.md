## Definitions
Hereafter "the documentation" will mean all content published from the repository https://github.com/sk0va/devbok or its forks.


## Disclaimer
The documentation contains only the thoughts and experiences of its authors and contributors and doesn't guarantee anything. It is not an instruction to make something or anything like that. You may use any ideas from the documentation for your own purpose and to your own full responsibility. You may also share any ideas from the documentation if you wish but with respect to the authors of these ideas. At least it is good to mention the sources of these. 

Authors and contributors of the documentation don't insist that anything they said is a final truth and can't be refuted. We believe that only with math people can produce final and incontrovertible objectively true statements. Because of that the documentation can't be determined as a source of objective truth despite all the logical arguments and references it contains. Things may change over time, technologies methodologies and approaches, especially in software development, are mutating constantly, and what was working in past may not be working in the future. And the documentation is not an exception. Discussions are always welcome!
